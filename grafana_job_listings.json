No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.\n\nHow do you know if you have a disability?\n\nA disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more of your “major life activities.” If you have or have ever had such a condition, you are a person with a disability.

You will own your product’s roadmap, collateral, and market research, and you will collaborate with Grafana leadership on fine-tuning your product’s goals. You will be the primary advocate and expert in your area, with a strong ability to communicate needs, functionality, and details effectively both to external customers and internal stakeholders. The teams and people you will be interacting with will be 100% remote and globally distributed, so strong and proactive communication is essential.</p>\n<p>Product Managers are the bridge that connect Engineering, Design, and UX to GTM.

Your areas of influence will also cover other agents, collectors, and ingestion services like Grafana Beyla, our OSS eBPF auto-instrumentation tool, and figuring out how to better incorporate and integrate these tools with Alloy.</p>\n<p>You’ll have to chart a roadmap that grows the OSS project, addresses internal requirements from other product teams, and delivers on end-user solutions with strong recommendations that make Alloy the de-facto collector alongside Grafana’s LGTM stack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a Product Manager at Grafana Labs, you will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transform ideas and feedback into a product vision and roadmap</li>\n<li>Empathize with customer problems in order to collect user needs, requirements, and pain points</li>\n<li>Curate and properly represent user feedback to Engineering, while providing evidence to support tradeoffs and priorities&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Work closely with PMM to enable GTM on product differentiation, including creating and updating presentations, documentation, website content, datasheets, and whitepapers.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Use your deep product expertise to make decisions about our go-to-market strategies, pricing, packaging, licensing and tiering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>We’re excited about you because you have:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A BS/BA in Computer Science, a related field, or equivalent work experience</li>\n<li>3+ years of experience in Product Management</li>\n<li>3+ years of experience in a B2B SaaS product&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Experience using or building agents, telemetry collectors, or related tools and services</li>\n<li>Experience using or building observability products and/or developer tools, either internally as an SRE or for external customers</li>\n<li>Experience with open source software and/or commercial open source companies</li>\n<li>Experience working with engineering teams to design and build products in a fast-paced environment</li>\n<li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bonus Points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with OpenTelemetery protocols, receivers, and exporters</li>\n<li>Experience with eBPF technologies</li>\n<li>Experience working with observability or data pipelines&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Experience working with or building ETL tools</li>\n<li>Experience partnering with UX to build delightful features with solid designs</li>\n<li>Familiarity with building an ecosystem of high quality integrations with third-parties</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Sweden, the Base compensation range for this role is</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" data-sheets-root=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:654251}\" data-sheets-numberformat=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;#,##0&quot;,&quot;3&quot;:1}\" data-sheets-formula=\"=ifna(VLOOKUP(R[0]C16,'Ranges by Country'!C4:C10,5,false),&quot;&quot;)\">654,251</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:785101}\" data-sheets-numberformat=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;#,##0&quot;,&quot;3&quot;:1}\" data-sheets-formula=\"=if(0.4*(R[0]C[2]-R[0]C[-1])+R[0]C[-1]=0,&quot;&quot;,0.4*(R[0]C[2]-R[0]C[-1])+R[0]C[-1])\">785,101</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp; Actual compensation may vary based on level, experience, and skillset as assessed in the interview process.

It allows our customers to leverage the best open source observability software – including Prometheus, Mimir, Loki, and Tempo – without the overhead of installing, maintaining and scaling their own observability stack</p>\n<p>The Observability department is focused on enabling developers to understand the health and performance of their applications and infrastructure in any environment by providing tools to instrument their code, ingest observability data into Grafana Cloud and visualize and explore it.</p>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry instrumentation team’s mission is to make sure our users succeed in instrumenting their applications with OpenTelemetry. We are not alone in this. We work closely with the OpenTelemetry SIGs to make OpenTelemetry SDKs and instrumentation libraries a success. Members of the OpenTelemetry instrumentation team are experts in at least one programming language and have a broad knowledge of various other programming languages.</p>\n<p>As a company we are remote-first and global, we embrace people of different experiences and backgrounds to build diverse teams where every person brings a unique perspective to the software. We are looking for Engineers that are passionate about communicating with data and providing seamless experiences for our customers to join our growing team! Engineers at Grafana also have the opportunity to contribute to Open Source communities.</p>\n<p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p>\n<p>At Grafana Labs, ICs have a dedicated career path and do not have to become managers to progress in their career. Principal software engineer is a leadership role for ICs. You are expected to have director-level scope, but with technical depth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Collaborate in open-source communities. </strong>You will contribute to the OpenTelemetry specification, and to OpenTelemetry components across a wide range of programming languages (.NET, Python, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, C++, Rust, and more).</li>\n<li><strong>Support and lead the technical direction of the team,</strong> and drive business conversations on the OpenTelemetry strategy at Grafana Labs.</li>\n<li><strong>Be visible as an OpenTelemetry expert.</strong> Teach others, promote best practices around OpenTelemetry, semantic conventions, and various technologies and frameworks. Both within Grafana Labs and in the broader OpenTelemetry community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we are remote-first and our engineering organization is largely remote, we provide guidance and meet regularly using video calls, so an independent attitude and good communication skills are a must.</p>\n<p><strong>What are we looking for in you?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>At Grafana Labs, we define senior roles via the scope of their business impact more than via their expertise or their specific activities. So the most important thing we are looking for in a principal engineer is the ability to take ownership, and drive both technical and business conversations on a director-level scope.</li>\n<li>You have a passion for observability and like to share your knowledge by writing documentation and blog posts.</li>\n<li>You love to engage with customers and help them out.</li>\n<li>You have excellent communication skills.</li>\n<li>You have relevant open source experience, ideally in OpenTelemetry or Prometheus.</li>\n<li>You are willing to become an active member of the OpenTelemetry community.</li>\n<li>You’re curious and you enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks, setting up examples, and figuring out how things work.</li>\n<li>You have a good understanding of typical production environments. Ideally you have been responsible for operating production services and organizing on-call.</li>\n<li>You actively mentor other team members, identifying areas for focus and improvement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">In Sweden, the base compensation range for this role is SEK <span data-sheets-root=\"1\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:949351}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:2113,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;#,##0&quot;,&quot;3&quot;:1},&quot;9&quot;:1,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:1}}\" data-sheets-formula=\"=ifna(VLOOKUP(R[0]C16,'Ranges by Country'!C4:C10,5,false),&quot;&quot;)\">949,351 - SEK <span data-sheets-root=\"1\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:1139220.6}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:2113,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;#,##0&quot;,&quot;3&quot;:1},&quot;9&quot;:1,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:1}}\" data-sheets-formula=\"=if(0.4*(R[0]C[2]-R[0]C[-1])+R[0]C[-1]=0,&quot;&quot;,0.4*(R[0]C[2]-R[0]C[-1])+R[0]C[-1])\">1,139,221</span></span>.

The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one.

No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.

No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.
